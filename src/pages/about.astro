    <h1>about the webmaster</h1>
    <p>
      For a start, my real name is Marcus! I was born in London in August 2009
      which makes me 16 & a Leo. My MBTI is INFP-T, and I'm gay XD
    </p>
    <p>
      I read a lot of romance novels & occasionally watch anime when one catches
      my eye. I've recently started reading reading more manhwa/yaoi and I'm
      getting addicted lowk.
    </p>
    <p>
      I love nature, going on long walks with my sister & mum, exploring. I've
      always been quite artistic and love watching theatre. I also really love
      making websites in my free time hence why I've re-made this site about
      3000 times. I also love playing games :3
    </p>
    <p>
      I made this website to have something to do other than scroll on tiktok,
      and because it's been ages since I made a personal website for myself!
    </p>
